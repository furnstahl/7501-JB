This is a partial list of good references.

The textbook will be John R. Taylor, [Classical Mechanics](https://library.ohio-state.edu/search/i?SEARCH=189138922), ISBN 1-891389-22-X. We will not be covering every section but the course will follow the book in large parts and reading and problem assignments will be given from the book.
