# Bibliography

This is a partial list of good references for 7501.

There is no single text for the course, but the ordering and emphasis of the presentation will be in the "Spins First" spirit of Dirac's classic text, as opposed to the "Wave Mechanics" approach (as in the widely used undergraduate QM text by Griffiths). The guiding graduate-level text will be

* Sakurai and Napolitano, [Modern Quantum Mechanics (3rd edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Quantum-Mechanics-J-Sakurai/dp/1108473229/ref=asc_df_1108473229/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459638379039&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=9443109611879288746&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9014989&hvtargid=pla-917614751646&psc=1);

with regular reference to (e.g., for the thorough treatment of linear algebra)

* Shankar, [Principles of Quantum Mechanics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-0576-8) (1994).

Sakurai and Napolitano assume already a strong background in math and quantum mechanics, which not everyone will have, so we will also refer to texts that follow the same Spins First philosophy but at a more relaxed pace and filling in more details:

* Townsend, [A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Approach-Quantum-Mechanics/dp/1891389785);
* McIntyre, [Quantum Mechanics: A Paradigms Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Paradigms-David-McIntyre/dp/0321765796/ref=asc_df_0321765796/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=330583280114&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14995948134173161693&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9014989&hvtargid=pla-571888386908&psc=1);
* Feynman, [Lecture on Physics, Volume III](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_toc.html).

An idiosyncratic text that complements Sakurai and Napolitano while offering clear insight into topics such as Bell's Theorem is

* Susskind and Friedman, [Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Mechanics-Theoretical-Leonard-Susskind/dp/0465062903).

Texts on quantum computing and/or entanglement that are also very good introductions to the basic principles of QM are

* Nielsen and Chuang, [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176)
* Brody, [Quantum Entanglement](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Entanglement-Press-Essential-Knowledge/dp/026253844X);
* Rieffel and Polak, [Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-Introduction-Engineering-Computation/dp/0262526670).

There are many books on Python programming and using Jupyter notebooks.
