# # Workflow for Jupyter notebook: cells $\rightarrow$ functions $\rightarrow$ classes
# 
# Here we illustrate how to start with global definitions and separate evaluations in cells and then in stages convert to functions and then to classes.
# 
# The next stage is to move the class and function definitions to external files and then to have a setup.py function.

# **General comments:**
# * This is only one possible workflow.
# * The idea here is to prototype things and then in steps see how to put it together.

# **Things to include:**
# * Multiple figures, converted to a function for plots.
# * Global variables, becoming local variables in a class.
