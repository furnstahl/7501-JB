# Using GitHub

## Installation of Physics-7501 Jupyter notebooks from GitHub by command line

Go to the location where you want the notebook files. 

Download the 7501 repository from GitHub and enter the directory `7501-JB` which should have been created on your computer:

    git clone https://github.com/furnstahl/7501-JB.git
    cd 7501-JB

The notebooks that we will be using depend on several scientific python modules (see the list in environment.yml) and require a python3.x installation based on Anaconda.
