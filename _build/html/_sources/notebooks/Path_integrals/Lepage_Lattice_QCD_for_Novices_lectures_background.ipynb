The starting point is one-dimensional quantum mechanics and that is where we focus our attention. The aim is to implement the calculations outlined by Lepage (updating some of the included Python code) and then switch to using some of the standard libraries for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) designed for Bayesian inference.\n",

We'll combine with a uniform prior to make a posterior. If we sample the posterior with MCMC methods, we are sampling the paths according to the weighting by the action. We can use the samples to take quantum mechanical expectation values. \n"
